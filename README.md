## Introduction
> SurfPatch is a framework for exploratory stream surface visualization, addressing the challenges of placement, speed, perception, and evaluation in surface-based flow visualization. The method translates surface placement into a selection problem, leveraging a hierarchical, bottom-up approach with vertex-level classification, patch-level matching, and surface-level clustering for fine-grained multiscale analysis. SurfPatch supports both steady and unsteady flows and isosurfaces from scalar fields, providing an intuitive interface for users to explore and analyze stream surfaces.
