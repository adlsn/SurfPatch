This is the official repository for the paper `SurfPatch: Enabling Patch Matching for Exploratory Stream Surface Visualization`.

## Introduction
> Particles in a 3D flow field form the stream surface. Tornado, Bernard, and two swirls are typical flow data. In this project, we want to use multiple `surfpatches` to characterize stream surface features, cluster these patches by their inherent patterns, and assist domain experts in attaining and analyzing similar surfaces.
